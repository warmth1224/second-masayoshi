  description: "Hi! I'm Masayoshi Yamada — a full stack engineer who builds fast backends, clean UIs, and sleeps soundly because of test coverage. I speak JavaScript fluently, automate the boring stuff, and ship code that scales (and rarely cries in prod). 9+ years in FinTech, SaaS, and keeping CI green. Let’s build something solid.",
